    Cog for handling the 'shelf_book' command in a Discord bot.
    
    This cog provides functionality for users to temporarily shelf a book they are currently reading.
    It interacts with the user via a slash command, presenting a selection of books marked as 'Currently Reading'.
    If the user has no such books, an appropriate message is sent. Handles errors gracefully and provides feedback.
