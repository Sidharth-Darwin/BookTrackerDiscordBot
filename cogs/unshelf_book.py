    """
    Cog for handling the 'unshelf_book' command in a Discord bot.
    This cog provides functionality for users to un-shelve books that are currently marked as 'Shelved'.
    When the command is invoked, it checks if the user has any books with the 'Shelved' status.
    If books are found, it presents a selection view for the user to choose which book to un-shelve.
    If no books are found or an error occurs, an appropriate message is sent to the user.
    Attributes:
        bot (commands.Bot): The Discord bot instance.
    Methods:
        unshelf_book(interaction: Interaction):
            Slash command handler for un-shelving a book. Presents a selection view if books are available,
            otherwise notifies the user. Handles exceptions gracefully.
